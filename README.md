<h1>This is a project I made for downloading youtube videos to mp4 or mp3. It uses yt-dlp as for the API and ffmpeg for the sound merge</h1>
<p>I open sourced this project because its nothing crazy.</p>
<p>I'd also love contributors. For example a friend asked to make playlist downloader which ill try to add</p>
